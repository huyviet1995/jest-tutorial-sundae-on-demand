* TODO Now it is time for me to do the toppings part of Sundaes On Demand man
** TODO Things to do right here.

CLOCK: [2021-7-6 Tue 23:19]
* DONE Now it is time for me to fix the last test man!

CLOCK: [2021-7-10 Sat 13:23]
* TODO I am still working on the jest tutorial. However, I don't know how the React Context is used right here man. 
** TODO Here is the step by step as I can see it
1. a context called OrderDetails is created using the createContext(). This will return a context so it can be imported in other place
2. Create a provider called OrderDetailsProvider. This is a React Component that will return the <Context.Provider> 
3. Wrap the ContextProvider around all the children components WHERE the data provided by the Context should be used
4. And then in order to use the context data within a children component, I will just need to call the context hook and then extract all the data/variabled provided by the Context Hook 

> Regarding the React testing, I mean I was having troubles with testing that API, is that correct?
> In case there is an axios calls, and then some components will be rendered after the API call returns some results => how should I handle the problem?
> Humh, to do this, I will probably need to clone the code and start working on this by myself
* DONE Yes, will need to setup this man
? What is the problem in here exactly?
> The problem in here is that WHEN I open the modal delete button
=> I could clearly see that the "do you want to remove the user" text content appear. This sounds valid because of the fact that if I don't call the user event then this text will not appear
? However, when the text appears, the close button even though it shows up in the console, does not get detected. Why is this happening?
> This raises a question why the heck accessible role is not detected even though the element clearly show up in the DOM
> Humh, I see. This is because of the fact that hidden is set to false by default
? Then what is hidden used for in this case?
> Cool, I can see that the aria-hidden = true => therefore, button will be listed as one of the accessible role
> Also, only when the modal is visible can I query the button with the role=hidden
CLOCK: [2021-7-10 Sat 15:27]
* TODO Now the next problem I am having troubles with is that even though I have done clicking the Close Button, I did expect that /do you want to remove user/ should be removed. However, it is still in the DOM for some reasons. I will need to check out why this is happening man?
> Humh, I have come up with a new strategy. That is WHEN I click the closeBtn => I expect it to disappear however, there are mu

> I am getting freaking confused right here. even though I have clicked the removeButton
> I expect that that the modal with the remove user should show up right.

CLOCK: [2021-7-10 Sat 16:27]
* TODO Another question I would like to ask is that even though I have clicked the button to open the modal => the aria hidden does not get changed to aria-hidden=true
> What I would like to see is that waitFor should wait AFTER the DOM has finished updated, not before it man
> I have just come up with something pretty cool.
> What happens if after I click the close btn => I will probably wait for the diaglog to not hidden
> Okay, seems like I have seriously stuck with this
> I will need to find a way
> In the documentation, it says that waitFor is used to check if an API is called correctly or if an element will appear in the DOM
> it does not say anything about 
> Humh, waitFor when I read the document, states that whenever the DOM changes, it will call again. but I don't see anything happening man
> Something just dawns on me 
> I believe that this happens because I don't actually include the COnfirmModal right here?
> No the ConfirmModal is definitely in the DOM. if it is not in the DOM, then I will not be able to see the HTML attributes related to this!
> I will probably stop doing this for now so I can come back later

* TODO Alright let's keep working on the Sundae on demands. I am having troubles right here.
** DONE I would like to make the test pass!

CLOCK: [2021-7-11 Sun 16:10]
* TODO First thing first, Assert on default toppings subtotal
? How should I do this man?
> This means I will need to change the default options to something else.
? What is something else I would like to talk about here?
** DONE I am having some troubles right here. Because each topping has the price of 1.5. I do expect that the Toppings Total should be equal 1.5 not 0. Why it is showing 0 right here?
> I will need to look into the problem to see why this is happening man?
> I can see that something weird going on right here.
? I can clearly see that even though the optionType is 'toppings', the optionCount is still 0
> This happens because I will need to code to go through 
CLOCK: [2021-7-11 Sun 17:8]
** TODO Next point is, find and tick one box, assert on updated subtotal
? What does it mean by ticking one box and asserting on updated total?
> Ah I see what the author means by this. I believe that what she meant
> I believe what she meant was that the subtotal for the toppings option is not calculated unless I check the box
> if this is the case, then I will need to come up with a solution.
*** DONE so I will probably create a checkbox for the subtotal again

*** TODO implement this to pass the test when I click the checkbox => then subtotal will be taken into account
> Humh, I am having some troubles right here. 
> does expect after calling userEvent.click happens asynchronously?
> I believe that it should because when the user clicks the icecreamCheckbox => updateItemCount happen again, which should re-render the whole component
> but then the toppingSubtotals still pass the expect test. Which is kinda weird for me

*** TODO Alright, let's start working on the grand totals right here
